1. You have done well

2. Take note of questions where ou were required to answer the questions in bash

3. Do not mix bash and python syntax together.

4. The question on hello.sh Brian, i expected you to have 
      
      echo "hello $1"
      
      echo "How are you?"
      
      
 $1 represents the first argument when you execute a file on the commanline
 
 Keep practicing you are doing quite well with python, polish it up.
